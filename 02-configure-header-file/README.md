# Example Project: Configure Header File
Configuring files using CMake provides several benefits. It enables you to:
Customize Build Parameters: Configuration files allow you to set project-specific variables, such as version numbers, build options, and feature flags, during the build process. This customization enhances the flexibility and adaptability of your application.

- **Ensure Portability**: By utilizing CMake's variable substitution syntax and providing input and output paths using CMake variables, you can ensure that the configuration process remains portable across different systems and configurations.

- **Integrate Configuration with the Build**: The `configure_file()` command is executed during the CMake configure step, which occurs when generating build system files. This integration ensures that the configuration process is seamlessly incorporated into the build process, keeping the generated files up-to-date.

- **Facilitate Versioning and Git Integration**: By retrieving Git information, such as commit hashes, commit messages, and repository URLs, during the configuration process, you can embed this information into your application. This enables version tracking and provides valuable insights into the source code used to build the application.

In the following sections, we will explore best practices for using CMake's `configure_file()` command and demonstrate how to configure a header file in an example project.

## Best Practices for configure_file()
When using CMake's configure_file() command, there are several best practices to follow. One of these practices involves utilizing a static C or C++ file template and header file to improve build times.

By using a static template file, you can avoid unnecessary recompilation of files that don't require any changes, thus speeding up the build process.

When using CMake's `configure_file()` command, there are several best practices to follow:

- **Use a Template File**: Create a template file (e.g., version.c.in, version.h.in) with placeholders or variables that need to be replaced during the configuration process. The template file should contain the necessary logic and structure, including any conditional statements or loops.

- **Specify Input and Output Paths**: Provide the paths to the input template file and the desired output file. Use CMake variables to specify these paths, ensuring portability across different systems and configurations.

- **Use Configurable Variables**: Define variables in your CMakeLists.txt file that hold the values to be substituted in the template file. These variables can be CMake variables (set()) or project-specific variables (project()).

- **Configure at Build Time**: The `configure_file()` command is executed during the CMake configure step, which occurs when generating build system files. This ensures that the configuration process is integrated into the build process and that the generated files are up-to-date.

- **Use Variable Substitution Syntax**: Inside the template file, use CMake's variable substitution syntax to indicate where variable values should be inserted. The syntax can vary depending on the chosen format, such as `${VARIABLE}` or `@VARIABLE@`.

- **Enable or Disable Features**: Use conditional statements within the template file to enable or disable certain features or settings based on user-defined variables or system conditions. This allows for flexible configurations based on different build scenarios.

- **Avoid Overwriting User-Modified Files**: When generating files using `configure_file()`, be cautious not to overwrite user-modified files. Provide clear instructions in your project documentation, advising users to avoid modifying generated files and indicating which files should be excluded from version control systems.

- **Handle Error Cases**: Handle error cases gracefully by checking for errors during the configuration process. For example, ensure that required files or variables are present and display informative error messages when issues occur.

- **Keep Templates Simple**: Keep template files as simple and focused as possible. Complex logic or extensive code generation should be avoided within the template files themselves. Instead, encapsulate complex logic in CMake scripts or functions and call them from the template files.

- **Validate and Test Configuration**: Validate and test the configuration process to ensure that the generated files are correct and reflect the desired configuration. Write tests to verify the behavior of the configured files and include them in your project's test suite.

By following these best practices, including the use of a static C/C++ file template, you can effectively use configure_file() to generate configuration files that adapt to different build environments. This approach helps to speed up the build time by avoiding unnecessary recompilation of files that don't require changes.

##  CMakeLists.txt Explanation

The CMakeLists.txt file contains the necessary instructions for CMake to configure and build the project. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

- **Setting the minimum CMake version**: The cmake_minimum_required() function sets the minimum required version of CMake to 3.5 for this project.

- **Defining the project**: The project() function sets the project name to "exampleproject" and its version to "1.0.1".

- **Retrieving Git information**: Several execute_process() commands are used to retrieve information from the Git repository. This includes the latest abbreviated commit hash, commit message, commit status (checking for uncommitted changes), repository URL, and the hostname of the build machine.

- **Displaying project information**: The retrieved Git information and project-specific variables are displayed using message(STATUS) to provide insight into the project's configuration. This can be useful for debugging and understanding the build environment.

- **Configuring template files**: The configure_file() command processes the version.cpp.in template file and generates the version.cpp file in the binary directory. It replaces variables in the template using the ${VARIABLE} syntax, allowing the file to reflect the project's version and Git information.

- **Adding executable target**: The add_executable() function adds the main.cpp file and the generated version.cpp file to the executable target. This ensures that both files are compiled and linked together to create the final executable.

- **Including project source directory**: The target_include_directories() function is used to include the project source directory. This allows the version.hpp file (presumably included in main.cpp) to be used throughout the program, ensuring proper access to the version-related information.

## Building the Example

To perform an out-of-source build, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for the build process. This directory can be named `build`, `bin`, or any other descriptive name.
2. Navigate to the newly created build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Run the CMake command from the build directory, specifying the path to the source code directory. For example:
   ```bash
   cmake /path/to/source/code
   ```
4. CMake will generate the build files (e.g., Makefiles, Visual Studio solution files) in the build directory based on the CMakeLists.txt file in the source code directory.
5. Build the project using the generated build system (e.g., Makefiles):
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
6. The built binaries and artifacts will be placed in the build directory, keeping them separate from the source code.
7. From the build directory, run the resulting executable:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```
You should see the output from the "hello" program.

> **_NOTE:_** It's important to note that the build directory should be excluded from version control systems (e.g., Git) by adding it to the project's .gitignore file. This ensures that the build artifacts are not inadvertently committed to the repository.
