# Example Project: clang-format 

Cppcheck is an open-source static code analysis tool designed for C and C++ codebases. Its main purpose is to help developers identify potential bugs, errors, and security vulnerabilities in their source code. By analyzing the code without executing it, cppcheck can catch various issues that might otherwise go unnoticed during regular compilation or testing.

Here are some key features of cppcheck:

- **Static Analysis**: cppcheck performs static code analysis, which means it examines the source code without actually executing it. It scans the code for common programming errors, potential bugs, and coding style issues.

- **Wide Range of Checks**: cppcheck includes a broad set of checks that cover various aspects of C and C++ programming, including memory management, undefined behavior, resource leaks, and more.

- **Customizable Checks**: Developers can configure the tool to enable or disable specific checks depending on their project's requirements.

- **Integration with Build Systems**: cppcheck can be integrated into various build systems and development environments, allowing developers to incorporate it seamlessly into their workflow.

- **User-Friendly Output**: The tool provides clear and concise reports, making it easier for developers to understand and fix the identified issues.

- **Command-Line Interface and GUI**: cppcheck can be used through its command-line interface (CLI) for automation and scripting purposes. Additionally, it offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for more interactive usage.

- **Regular Updates**: The cppcheck project is open-source and actively maintained, meaning that it receives updates and improvements to keep up with the evolving best practices and language standards.

- **Cross-Platform Support**: cppcheck is designed to work on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like operating systems.

## Benefits of Reusing Common and Popular Format Files
Reusing common and popular format files offers several advantages:

1. **Consistency**: Adopting well-established style guides ensures consistent code formatting throughout the project, enhancing readability and reducing merge conflicts.

2. **Community Standard**: Using popular format files aligns your project with widely accepted coding standards followed by the community.

3. **Time Savings**: Leveraging existing format files saves time that would otherwise be spent defining coding styles from scratch.

4. **Maintainability**: A consistent coding style makes the codebase more maintainable, enabling developers to focus on the logic rather than formatting.

Here are a few references to popular .clang-format files and style guides:

- **LLVM Project's .clang-format**: GitHub repository: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/tools/clang-format/.clang-format. This is the .clang-format file used by the LLVM project. It's quite comprehensive and well-documented.

- **Google's C++ Style Guide**: Link: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html. While this is not a direct .clang-format file, it provides a detailed style guide that you can follow and adjust according to your project's needs.

- **Chromium's .clang-format**: GitHub repository: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/refs/heads/main/.clang-format. Chromium is the open-source project behind Google Chrome, and its .clang-format file reflects the coding style used in the project.

- **Mozilla's .clang-format**: GitHub repository: https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/master/.clang-format
Mozilla's .clang-format file aligns with the coding style used in the Gecko project, which powers the Mozilla Firefox browser.

- **Facebook's .clang-format**: GitHub repository: https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/.clang-format
Facebook's .clang-format file is used for the Folly library and showcases a different style from the previous examples.


## Clang Format Configurator

The clang-format-configurator provides an easy way to create or modify existing `.clang-format` files based on your preferred style. You can interactively adjust various formatting options and generate the file to match your project's requirements:

##  CMakeLists.txt Explanation

The CMakeLists.txt and clang-format.cmake files in this project demonstrate how to integrate cppcheck into a CMake-based project with subprojects.

- **In the root `CMakeLists.txt`**, the project is set up with the name exampleproject, and the C++ language standard is set to `C++11`. The `include/clang-format.cmake` file is included, and two subdirectories, subproject1 and subproject2, are added for the corresponding subprojects.

- **In `CMakeLists.txt` within each subproject folder**, an executable target is created for the respective subproject using the main1.cpp and main2.cpp source files.

- **The `clang-format.cmake` file** contains the configuration for formatting the source files using clang-format.

- **The `find_program` command** checks if clang-format is installed on the system. If it's not found, the script will print an error message and stop the CMake configuration process.

- **The `CLANG_FORMAT_CXX_FILE_EXTENSIONS` variable** specifies the file extensions that will be checked by clang-format.

- **The `file(GLOB_RECURSE ...)` command** is used to gather all source files with the specified file extensions, which will be checked for formatting.

- **The `CLANG_FORMAT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS` variable** contains patterns to exclude certain files or directories from being formatted. The script iterates through each source file and checks if its path matches any of the exclusion patterns. If it does, the file is removed from the list of source files to be checked. The script outputs the list of source files that will be considered for formatting.

- **Two custom targets**, format and format-check, are created to format the source files and check for formatting issues, respectively. The format target applies the formatting changes using clang-format -style=LLVM -i, while the format-check target checks for differences in formatting using clang-format -style=LLVM --dry-run.

- **The `COMMAND_ERROR_IS_FATAL`** is omitted from the format-check target. If there are formatting differences, the build won't fail, but it will display the affected files and lines.


## Building the Example

To perform an out-of-source build, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for the build process. This directory can be named `build`, `bin`, or any other descriptive name.
2. Navigate to the newly created build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```
3. Run the CMake command from the build directory, specifying the path to the source code directory. For example:
   ```bash
   cmake /path/to/source/code
   ```
4. CMake will generate the build files (e.g., Makefiles, Visual Studio solution files) in the build directory based on the CMakeLists.txt file in the source code directory.
5. Build the project using the generated build system (e.g., Makefiles):
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
6. The built binaries and artifacts will be placed in the build directory, keeping them separate from the source code.
7. From the build directory, run the resulting executable:
   ```bash
   ./hello
   ```
You should see the output from the "hello" program.

> **_NOTE:_** It's important to note that the build directory should be excluded from version control systems (e.g., Git) by adding it to the project's .gitignore file. This ensures that the build artifacts are not inadvertently committed to the repository.

## Analyzing and Formatting

To check if the code complies with the defined style guide, run the following commands:

- Format all source files in the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --target format
   ```
- Check if all source files match the style guide:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --target format-check
   ```

- Check only changed files in git repository against the style guide:
   ```bash
   cmake --build . --target format-check-changed
   ```

## Integration with Continuous Integration (CI)

You can integrate the code formatting checks into your CI/CD pipeline. By running `format-check-changed` target, you can ensure that code contributions adhere to the defined coding style.
