Test Execution Summary
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: A summary of the overall test execution, including the number of tests
  conducted, pass/fail rates, and any deviations from expected results.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: The Test Execution Summary is a critical component of
  the test report, offering a concise overview of the testing process. In the
  ISO 26262 context, it plays a pivotal role in demonstrating the thoroughness and
  completeness of the testing activities performed. This summary provides insights
  into the quantity and quality of tests conducted, helping to assess the system's
  functional safety.

Performance Test Results
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: Results and analysis of performance testing, including response times,
  throughput, and resource utilization.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: Performance Test Results within the test report are
  essential for evaluating the automotive system's ability to meet performance
  requirements. ISO 26262 emphasizes the significance of performance in the context
  of functional safety. These results contribute to ensuring that the system
  operates within specified performance limits, aligning with safety goals and
  reliability expectations.

Security Test Results
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: Findings from security testing activities, detailing vulnerabilities,
  if any, and recommended remediation measures.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: Security Test Results are paramount for addressing potential
  threats to the automotive system's functional safety. In accordance with ISO 26262,
  these results provide insights into the system's resilience against security risks.
  The documentation of vulnerabilities and recommended remediation measures supports
  the overall goal of ensuring a secure and robust automotive system.

Coverage Analysis
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: The test report may include coverage analysis, which assesses the extent
  to which the system has been tested. This includes code coverage for software
  components and other coverage metrics relevant to the safety goals.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: Coverage Analysis is crucial within the context of ISO 26262
  to demonstrate the thoroughness of testing and verification activities. This analysis
  aligns with the standard's emphasis on achieving high levels of coverage, including
  code coverage for software components. It serves as evidence that the testing
  process adequately addresses the safety goals defined for the automotive system.

Traceability
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: ISO 26262 emphasizes traceability, and test reports should demonstrate
  traceability between the test cases and the safety requirements. This ensures that
  each requirement has been adequately tested and validated.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: Traceability within test reports is integral to ISO 26262
  compliance. It ensures that each safety requirement has undergone proper testing,
  providing a clear linkage between safety goals, requirements, and the testing
  activities conducted. This emphasis on traceability is vital for demonstrating
  the completeness and effectiveness of the testing process in achieving functional
  safety.

Defect Tracking
--------------------------------------------
- Purpose: Documentation of identified defects or issues, including their severity,
  status, and resolution.
- ISO 26262 Perspective: Defect Tracking is a fundamental aspect of the test report
  within the ISO 26262 framework. It serves as evidence of the identification,
  classification, and resolution of defects, aligning with the standard's focus on
  achieving a high level of software reliability. The documentation of defect severity,
  status, and resolution contributes to the overall understanding of the system's
  functional safety.
