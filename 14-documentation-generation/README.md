```
## Directory Structure
The project directory structure is as follows:
```
project/
    CMakeLists.txt          # Main CMake configuration file
    src/                    # Source code directory
        main.cpp            # Main application source file
    include/                # Header files directory
        mylib.h             # Example header file
    build/                  # Build directory (create this)
    CMake/                  # CMake-related configuration files (create this)
```


## CMake Targets
